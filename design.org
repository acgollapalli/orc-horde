#+TITLE: Orc Horde Design Doc
#+AUTHOR: Caleb Gollapalli

* Summary:
A Mini-Rogue-Like in which you go fight the orcs, one mission at a time.
Every mission pushes the orcs a little further back, but after you level up, the orcs come back to fight against you harder than ever.
The longer you go without a mission in real time, the more the orc's will overrun you.
If you clear the area completely, you get a few days of peace, but then, the orcs will come back with a vengeance, and they never stop.

* Gameplay loop:
Missions of 5 minutes max. Should be no longer than a game of overwatch or marvel rivals.
As you the player get better, you get flashier bigger badder guns and melee weapons.

* Tasks:
** DONE Hello Triangle
** DONE Loading Meshes into AssetDB
** DONE Instanced Rendering of Meshes

We can rotate, but we may have messed up the handedness of our meshes somehow.
** BUG Game crashes on resize

** TEST World Space to Screen Space Coordinates.
** TODO Input
