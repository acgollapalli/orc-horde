#+TITLE: Orc Horde Design Doc
#+AUTHOR: Caleb Gollapalli

* Summary:
A Mini-Rogue-Like in which you go fight the orcs, one mission at a time.
Every mission pushes the orcs a little further back, but after you level up, the orcs come back to fight against you harder than ever.
The longer you go without a mission in real time, the more the orc's will overrun you.
If you clear the area completely, you get a few days of peace, but then, the orcs will come back with a vengeance, and they never stop.

* Gameplay loop:
Missions of 5 minutes max. Should be no longer than a game of overwatch or marvel rivals.
As you the player get better, you get flashier bigger badder guns and melee weapons.



* Tasks:
** DONE Hello Triangle
** DONE Loading Meshes into AssetDB
** DONE Instanced Rendering of Meshes
** KNOWNCAUSE Rotation
We can rotate, but we may have messed up the handedness of our meshes somehow.
** BUG Game crashes on resize
** INPROGRESS Figure out how to get textures for different meshes
** BUG Map texture is mirrored
maybe an export problem?
** TEST World Space to Screen Space Coordinates.
*** DONE Top down view
Our world is approx 8 units tall and 10.8 units wide
orcs will stream in from (x, 4) for now
*** TODO FPS view
May not be feasible. Will need to test. But it will have right handed coordinates.

** TODO Input
** TODO Tiles
** TODO Player Interface
** TODO Core Game Loop
** TODO Switch to SDL
** TODO WebGPU Backend
** HOLD Music
** TODO Loading Textures into AssetDB

** TODO Long period of white window due to assets loading.
Because we're loading assets into the thing dynamically we don't actually start rendering frames
til after we've at least read the map file.

We need to have SOMETHING display while files are loading. May mean that we simply paint a loading screen and then init the game state.
